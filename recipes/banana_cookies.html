   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>This is the <strong>BEST</strong> cookie recipe of all time. It's gooey and soft even when fully cooked. You can make the balls of dough twice as large and add a couple extra minutes of bake time to make them similar in texture to a pumpkin cookie. You will want to use bananas that are starting to get brown spots, but it's okay if they get to banana bread ripeness. It's hard to go wrong with this cookie.</p>
   <p>There are walnuts in this recipe, but they can be excluded and no other major food alergens are present. You can also substitute the walnuts for other nuts like pecans if you don't have walnuts on hand.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1/2 cup mashed banana (from 2 bananas)</li>
    <li>2/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>4 ounces dark chocolate chocolate chips</li>
    <li>1/3 cup walnuts, finely chopped</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, add the mashed banana, brown sugar, sugar and melted butter. Whisk until smooth. Don't be shy to break up any banana bits as you're whisking. You want it pretty smooth. Add in the baking soda and salt. Mix again.</li>
    <li>Add the flour and, switching to a spatula, fold it in. Pour in the chocolate chunks or chips and walnuts. Fold them in until combined. Cover with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge to chill for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment. Scoop out 6 balls of dough and roll each one in between your palms. Space them about 3 inches apart. Bake them in the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until the edges are medium golden brown. Repeat with the remaining cookie dough. The cookies will be a bit puffy and will fall as they cool. Allow them to cool for about 10 minutes.</li>
   </ol>
