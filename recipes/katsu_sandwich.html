    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A beautiful fusion of Katsu Sandwiches with Southern Hot Chicken. It's incredibly spicy and flavorful, so you may need to remove some cayenne if you can't handle the heat. If you can though, these sandwiches are to die for.</p>
    <p>The milk bread isn't entirely necessary, but make sure you go with a more dense and sweet bread to complement the spicy chicken.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped bread-and-butter pickles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plus 1/4 cup hot sauce (like Frank's Red Hot Sauce)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 cups panko</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs pounded to 1/2" thickness</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>8 slices milk bread</li>
        <li>Shredded butter lettuce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine mayonnaise, pickles, and 2 Tbsp. hot sauce in a small bowl. Season with salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, cayenne, garlic powder, and remaining 1 tsp. salt in a medium bowl. Whisk egg and remaining 1/4 cup hot sauce in another medium bowl. Place panko on a large plate. Working one at a time, dip chicken into flour dredge, turning to coat. Shake off any excess. Dip into egg mixture until coated, shaking off excess. Dredge in panko, turning to coat. Transfer to a large plate or a small rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working in 2 batches, cook chicken, reducing heat to medium if it's browning too quickly, until golden and very crisp on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a wire rack.</li>
        <li>Spread reserved spicy mayo on one side of each slice of bread. Top with chicken and shredded lettuce, then close up sandwiches.</li>
    </ol>
